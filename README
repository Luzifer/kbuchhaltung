This application is BETA software at the moment. It should work but there is no
warranty for it. If you want to use it feel free to do so and please report any
bugs or feature requests to the bug tracker. You might participate at the
development if you like to.

The bug tracker is available at this URL: http://bugs.knut.me/

=== Requirements ===
Server:
- PHP4, PHP5 (Tested with 5.2.3-1ubuntu6.3 and 5.2.6-pl7-gentoo)
- MySQL4, better MySQL5 (Tested with 5.0.45-1ubuntu3.3 and 5.0.60-r1)

Client:
- Mozilla Firefox >= 1.5 (Tested with 3.0 - 3.0.3)
- Microsoft Internet Explorer >= 6.0 (Tested with 7)
- Apple Safari >= 2.0 (Tested with 3.1.2)
- Opera >= 9.25 (Tested with 9.60 - 9.62)

=== INSTALLATION ===
1. Copy the files onto a webserver with PHP and MySQL
2. Create a User, Password and Database at the MySQL service
3. Change the config.inc.php file in the interface directory
4. Access the application. It will call an installer which should
   install the table structure and some initial data. If you see
   no exception and return to the application showing some empty
   accounts everything went well and you can use the application.
   Otherwise you will need to follow the hints into the exceptions
   to get this application working.
   Please remember: The installer is still very basic and is only
   intended to help you with setting up the database structure.

=== UPDATE ===
pre0.5 -> 0.5:
   The format of the configuration file has changed in this version and
   old configuration files will not longer work. You have to modify the
   one from the repository to your needs.
   Also the database structure has changed. You have to create a additional
   table called 'appsettings' and insert a value by yourself. The structure
   is included into the file 'sql/structure.sql'. The key-value-pair which
   has to be inserted is 'version' => '0.5'.

=== SECURITY ===
Please pay attention while using this application. You provide your data free
to the internet. You really should set up this application in a secure 
environment to prevent any unauthorized person to access your data. Also please
set up at least a basic authentication for the application because this 
application does not provide any authentication by itself at the moment.
