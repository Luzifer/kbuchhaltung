=== INSTALLATION ===
1. Copy the files onto a webserver with PHP and MySQL
2. Create a User, Password and Database at the MySQL service
3. Change the config.inc.php file in the interface directory
4. Access the application. It will call an installer which should
   install the table structure and some initial data. If you see
   no exception and return to the application showing some empty
   accounts everything went well and you can use the application.
   Otherwise you will need to follow the hints into the exceptions
   to get this application working.
   Please remember: The installer is still very basic and is only
   intended to help you with setting up the database structure.

=== SECURITY ===
Please pay attention while using this application. You provide your data free
to the internet. You really should set up this application in a secure 
environment to prevent any unauthorized person to access your data. Also please
set up at least a basic authentication for the application because this 
application does not provide any authentication by itself at the moment.
